# Underwater Node Localization  

This project presents a smart solution for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) by implementing and enhancing the DV-Hop localization algorithm. It integrates Machine Learning to improve accuracy in dynamic and unpredictable underwater environments. 

# üìò Project Overview  

Accurate node localization is critical in UWSNs, where GPS is not viable. This project addresses the challenge using:

* DV-Hop algorithm for range-free localization
* ML-based optimization to refine hop distance estimates
* Performance comparison with traditional techniques like TDoA
* Mobility visualization using NetAnim

By simulating realistic underwater environments and integrating ML models, the system reduces localization errors and adapts to the movement of nodes caused by ocean currents.
